===========================================================

PLEASE NOTE: Authorize.net has released an official PHP 5 SDK for all
their APIs including the Customer Information Manager. I have since
migrated my code to this new back-end SDK and no longer use this class.
It was necessary at the time but should not be used anymore.

===========================================================

I needed something to do CIM stuff in Zend Framework. I've found several
classes but they were pretty old (didn't support new methods/parameters),
generally *very* large, and didn't use extensions like SimpleXML as much
as they could have.

I know this doesn't hold your hand as much but it will always work with
new methods and parameters and it has a clean object-oriented interface.

The idea is that you can wrap this class with another one that is more suited
for your needs. You could write a method that only takes a user object or id
and the wrapper class builds out whatever information is needed for the call
in this class.

The documentation and error codes from authorize.net at
	http://www.authorize.net/support/CIM_XML_guide.pdf
is helpful with figuring out what methods are available and what parameters
are required or accepted for each method.

Maybe someone else will find this useful as well?

Version 0.3 on 26 Aug 2010

	This was the first version that I felt was acceptable for use in
	my own project. Basically feature complete. I didn't publish any versions
	previous to this.

Version 0.3.1 on 28 Aug 2010

	This was a quick bug fix that corrected a problem with the $result->ok
	shortcut always being true.

Version 0.4 on 29 Dec 2010

	This is an improvement to the class which removed all public variables
	and modified how it is instantiated. Calls can leave off 'Request' and
	it will be added automatically by the class. Cleaned up code to keep line
	lengths short, be more careful with types, reduce number of internal
	methods, and move more details into class variables. Added checks for
	required PHP modules.
