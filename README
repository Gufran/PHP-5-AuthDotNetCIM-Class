===========================================================

I needed something to do CIM stuff in Zend Framework. I've found several classes but
they are pretty old (don't support new methods/parameters), generally *very* large,
and don't use extensions like SimpleXML as much as they could

I know this doesn't hold your hand as much but it will always work with new methods and
parameters and it has a clean object-oriented interface

Also the documentation and error codes from authorize.net are pretty helpful with figuring
out what you need to send. Maybe someone else will find this useful as well?
